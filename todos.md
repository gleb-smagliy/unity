To open source:
* Rename `soyuz*` -> `graphql-unite*` (should rename anyway, concrete titles TBD)
* CLI
* Rename `integration-sls` to `intergation-tests-fixture`. Refactor it to not to use sls
* Make an ability to not to use sls on local
* Remove extension-references
    * Remove storage
* Make TS interfaces for core entities, implement them with periphery packages (*.d.ts will be enough for zero-approach)
